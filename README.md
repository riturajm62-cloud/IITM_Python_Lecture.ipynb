# IITM Python Lecture Revision Repository
This repository contains my Python practice code and notes from the IIT Madras BS in Data Science program lectures.
## Purpose
* Revision of lecture concepts
* Practice of coding examples taught in class
* Quick reference before quizzes, assignments, and exams
* Organized storage of all lecture-wise practice code in one place
## Structure
 Each notebook/file includes:
* Lecture code examples
* My practice modifications
* Additional notes for better understanding
* Topic-wise revision content
## Current Contents
* Lecture 1: Python Basics
* Lecture 2: (Add topic name here)

(More lectures will be added regularly as the course progresses.)
## Note: This repository is mainly for learning and revision purposes.
It does not represent final projects or portfolio work, but a structured record of my coding practice and concept building during the IITM course.
